# 🎙️ Real-Time On-Device Speech-to-Speech Translation
### ⚡ Arm SME2 / NEON Optimized Android Application

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **fully on-device, real-time speech-to-speech translation system** optimized for Arm-based Android devices.

The application performs:

• 🎤 Speech Recognition (ASR)  
• 🌐 On-device Translation  
• 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
• 🔁 Real-time conversational pipeline  

All processing runs locally on the device without cloud inference.

## 🎯 Objective

To design and deploy a low-latency, energy-efficient speech translation system optimized for:

- 🧠 Arm CPUs
- ⚡ NEON acceleration
- 🔋 Mobile power & thermal constraints
- 📱 Real-time Android execution
